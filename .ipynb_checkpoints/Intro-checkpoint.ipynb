    "**To find the most cost-effective way of eliminating the spread of the West Nile Virus from the transmission through mosquitoes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The West Nile Virus has been raging through the city of Chicago. According to the CDC, the virus has been the main cause of mosquito-borne diesease in the United States and it is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. With the help of the Department of Public Health, data on mosquito infestation has been made available through their surveillance and control system. The data will help in determining where the best use of resource can be allocated to with the highest efficacy.\n",

    "### Context and Motivation\n",
    "The team at the Disease And Treatment Agency, which is a division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE), has been called upon to put the data together, analyse and put forth our recommendations. As with initiatives for public welfare and funded by the public, the aim is to direct the deployment of pesticides to areas which can yield the best results while keeping costs low.  \n",
